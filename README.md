#Final Project ideas for CSIS10A
##Remake of Space Invaders
In the haste of finishing all my classes 2 weeks early, I found it necessary to dig through online in order to build and understand a program as required for the Final Project. My final product is derived from online instruction. Though, I do understand the inner workings of the program as I went through step by step to write it out, I was still unsuccessful in enabling the program to full function as intended. I fly to Virginia in 6 hours, I can no longer dedicate any time to this program.
